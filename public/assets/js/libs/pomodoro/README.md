# pomodoro
#### A simple pomodoro timer written in JavaScript. Find it at http://roche.io/pomodoro/

There are plenty of timers like this online ([Moosti](http://moosti.com/), [Tomato Timer](http://tomato-timer.com/)), but the best workflow tool is the one you use. This was a quick side project for me in September 2015 to brush up on my web development and build something I would use myself. It takes the best features from all of the similar timers, and drops the cruft.

#### Features:
- Minutes remaining shown in browser tab
- Favicon change and alarm on timer complete (alarms provided by [AndYouAreWho](http://soundcloud.com/andyouarewho))
- Keyboard shortcuts using Mousetrap.js (hit space to pause/resume)
- Custom time with adjustable units
