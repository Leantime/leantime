### System Requirements ###

* PHP 8+
* MySQL 5.7+
* Apache or Nginx (IIS works with some modifications)

### Installation (Production) ###

* Download latest release package
* Create an empty MySQL database
* Upload entire directory to your server 
* Point your domain root to the `public/` directory
* Rename `config/.env.sample` to `config/.env`
* Fill in your database credentials (username, password, host, dbname) in `config/.env`
* Navigate to `<yourdomain.com>/install`
* Follow instructions to install database and set up first user account

### Installation (Development) ###

* Install composer and npm
* Clone repository to your local server
* Create MySQL database
* Run composer to load php dependencies
```
composer install
```
then
```
npm install
```
to load Javascript dependencies and finally run the grunt task to create the compiled js files
```
./node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt Build-All
```
* Point your local domain to the `public/` directory
* Rename `config/configuration.sample.php` to `config/configuration.php`
* Fill in your database credentials (username, password, host, dbname) in `config/configuration.php`
* Navigate to `<localdomain>/install`
* Follow instructions to install database and user account

### Installation via Docker ###

We maintain an official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/leantime/leantime">Docker image on dockerhub</a>. 
To run the image enter your MySQL credentials and execute. You can pass in all the configuration variables from .env

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 --network leantime-net \
-e LEAN_DB_HOST=mysql_leantime \
-e LEAN_DB_USER=admin \
-e LEAN_DB_PASSWORD=321.qwerty \
-e LEAN_DB_DATABASE=leantime \
-e LEAN_EMAIL_RETURN=changeme@local.local \
--name leantime leantime/leantime:latest
```

You can set any of the config variables in `config/configuration.php` when running the docker command.

Once started you can go to `<yourdomain.com>/install` and run the installation script.


### Running Locally

For development, we use a dockerized development environment. You will need to have
``docker``, ``docker compose``, ``make``, ``composer`` and ``npm`` installed. to run the application for development, in the root of this repository, run a primer with

```make clean build```

afterwards, run 

```make run-dev```

this will start the development server on port 8080.

The dev environment  provides a mysql server, mail server, s3 server, and should be good to go for your needs out of the box. The configuration of the development environment is found in ``.dev/.env``, and is already seeded with the appropriate values. **You should probably not be modifying this unless you plan to work on a feature for a specific integration**. the applications you get are as follows

* [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) : leantime
* [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) : maildev - to check emails sent
* [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) : phpmyadmin(authentication ``leantime:leantime``) to check the DB schema and data
* [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) : s3ninja - to check s3 uploads. You need to enable this in the ``.dev/.env`` file by enabling s3

Additionally, XDebug is enabled, but you will have to modify your 
IDE key in the ``.dev/xdebug.ini`` file(or alternatively, on your IDE). You also need to have port 9003 temporarily open on your firewall so you can utilize it effectively. This is because connections from docker to the host will count as external inbound connection


### Update ###

* Make sure to take a backup of your database and files
* Replace all files in your directory with the updated version
* If there were any database changes, the system will redirect your to `<yourdomain.com>/update`
