HTMLawed is ...
===============

... a single-file, 45 kb PHP script that makes input text more secure, HTML standards-compliant, and
suitable in general from the viewpoint of a web-page administrator, for use in the body of HTML, XHTML
or XML documents. A simple HTMLTidy alternative, the htmLawed filter, processor, purifier, sanitizer,
beautifier, etc., is highly customizable.

It ensures that HTML tags are balanced and properly nested tags, neutralizes code that may be used
for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, limits allowed HTML elements, attributes, or URL protocols,
tidies the code, and so forth.

As such is may serve as an alternative to [HTMLtidy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Tidy) in a
sanitation context.
