    <p>Blueprints are your chance to make sense of all the data. Leantime has a variety of tools and canvases to define your project background via Business Model Canvases, SWOT Analysis or Empathy Maps.<br /><br />
    If you don't know where to start we suggest you create a "Project Value Canvas". This canvas will answer the most important questions of your project:

        Who is your customer? <br />
        What problem are you solving?<br />
        What is your solution?<br />
        What benefit does your solution offer over your competitors<br />
    </p>
    <br /><br />
