            <p>Blueprints are your chance to make sense of all the data. Leantime has a variety of tools and canvases to define your project background via Business Model Canvases, SWOT Analysis or Empathy Maps.<br /><br />
            If you don't know where to start we suggest you create a "Project Value Canvas". This canvas will answer the most important questions of your project:

                Who is your customer? <br />
                What problem are you solving?<br />
                What is your solution?<br />
                What benefit does your solution offer over your competitors<br />
            </p>
            <br /><br />
