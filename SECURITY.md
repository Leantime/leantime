## Supported Versions

We currently support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |

| <=3.3   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Leantime takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Email security@leantime.io with details about the vulnerability
3. Allow up to 48 hours for an initial response
4. Work with us to resolve the issue before any public disclosure

For more information, visit our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://leantime.io/responsible-disclosure-policy/)

## Disclosure Timeframe

Once a disclosure has been accepted and fixed in a version we will wait for at least **2** version updates before disclosing to give people enough time to update. 
That means if a vulnerability was discovered in 2.4.1 and then fixed in 2.4.2 it will not be disclosed until we release 2.4.4.

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Leantime:
1. Always use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
2. Keep PHP and all dependencies up to date
3. Enable two-factor authentication
4. Use strong passwords
5. Regular backups

## Please refrain from asking for rewards

We thank all of you for your dedication to the craft. At this point we cannot offer any monetary rewards for disclosed vulnerabilities.
