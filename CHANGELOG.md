Changed the requirements from MySQL 5.7+ to MySQL 8.0+
The 5.7 version is not supported anymore since 2023-10-31 and will not get any security updates. We should not encourage our users to use old and insecure software.

MySQL 8.0 is the lowest version that is still supported by Oracle and is a LTS release (Generic support until 2025-04-30 and extended until 2026-04-30)

Changed the requirements from MySQL 5.7+ to MySQL 8.0+
The 5.7 version is not supported anymore since 2023-10-31 and will not get any security updates. We should not encourage our users to use old and insecure software.

MySQL 8.0 is the lowest version that is still supported by Oracle and is a LTS release (Generic support until 2025-04-30 and extended until 2026-04-30)
